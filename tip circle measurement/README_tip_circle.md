# 1. How to measure

Set the eccentricity length of the eccentric gear to 0,0.02,0.04,...,0.2 mm.

Keep the eccentric gear rotating and then use a dial indicator to record.

Plot the scatters and fit sinusoidal waves for every eccentricity length.

Calculate the amplitude of the sinusoidal waves.

# 2. Result

Despite some reasonable errors, the structure can successful and precisely realize the designed gear eccentricity setting.
